## Current Implementation Review
Container pattern implementation with progress tracking

## Recent Changes
1. Container Pattern Implementation:
   - Created ImageGeneratorContainer as main smart component
   - Implemented service-based image generation
   - Added progress tracking with visual feedback
   - Integrated cancellation support
   - Added multi-image generation for OpenAI

2. Progress Visualization:
   - Added progress bar implementation
   - Created Progress component in `src/components/ui/progress.tsx`
   - Updated progressAtom to handle value and text
   - Implemented percentage extraction from progress text
   - Added real-time progress updates

3. Service Layer:
   - Implemented ImageService interface
   - Created OpenAiImageService and NekoImageService
   - Added progress tracking support
   - Implemented action submission
   - Added type safety improvements

4. State Management:
   - Migrated to Jotai for global state
   - Created atomic state management
   - Implemented state reset functionality
   - Added progress state handling
   - Improved error state management

## Code Structure Analysis
### ImageGeneratorContainer
- Smart component managing generation flow
- Handles service interaction
- Manages progress updates
- Controls child components
- Implements cancellation

### Service Implementation
- Interface-based design
- Progress tracking support
- Action submission capability
- Error handling
- Type safety

## Potential Issues
1. Service Integration:
   - Need to test Neko API integration when endpoint is available
   - May need to handle different progress formats
   - Potential error format differences between providers
   - Model name normalization across services

2. Progress Tracking:
   - Different services may provide varying progress formats
   - Need to handle missing progress updates
   - Edge cases in percentage extraction
   - Progress update frequency optimization

3. State Management:
   - State reset during service switching
   - Progress state cleanup
   - Error state handling improvements
   - Action result persistence

## Next Steps
1. Service Enhancement:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add retry mechanism for failed requests
   - Standardize progress format across services
   - Add service health checks

2. Progress Tracking:
   - Improve progress text parsing
   - Add progress update throttling
   - Implement progress persistence
   - Add progress error states

3. Container Improvements:
   - Add loading state transitions
   - Implement progress animation
   - Add service switching logic
   - Improve error feedback

4. Testing:
   - Add unit tests for container
   - Test progress tracking
   - Verify service implementations
   - Test error scenarios

5. Documentation:
   - Update component documentation
   - Add service integration guide
   - Document progress tracking
   - Add error handling guide

## Technical Debt
1. Progress Implementation:
   - Progress format standardization
   - Update frequency optimization
   - Error state handling
   - Edge case coverage

2. Service Layer:
   - Error handling consistency
   - Progress tracking standardization
   - Action submission improvements
   - Type safety enhancements

3. State Management:
   - State cleanup optimization
   - Progress state persistence
   - Error state normalization
   - Action result handling
